#NeverNote

We have created a frontend, single page app using pure Javascript. The app has been created to meet the given user stories below.

We have implemented the app in pure Javascript and we have created our own test framework.

We have implemented both unit and feature tests.

At the moment the feature tests display is output to the index page, given more time we would have worked on this to output the results to a separate file. Given more time we would have liked to extract our testing framework.

## User stories
```
As a programmer
I can see a list of my notes, where each note is abbreviated to the first 20 characters
So I can find the one I want

As a programmer
I can create a new note
So I can record something I need to remember

As a programmer
I can see the full text of an individual note on its own page
So I can see all the information in the note
```
